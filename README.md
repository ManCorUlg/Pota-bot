<b>Introduction</b><br>
In a period when time and resources are increasingly scarce, the automation of everyday systems is one of the most important topics of research and innovation. The Faculty of Applied Sciences of the University of Liège has the chance to develop a space dedicated to the optimized cultivation of vegetable plants: the Pot’Ingé. Within the framework of the Major project in Electrical Engineering, the idea to develop a miniature vegetable garden with a fully autonomous watering system emerged. This system, called the Pota’bot, is based on the soil moisture needs of the plants it hosts. It waters them in the right quantity when necessary. As well as saving time for the gardeners, it saves water by watering each plant to the required moisture level. This report describes the approach followed to carry out this project, both in terms of the evolution of the initial idea and in terms of the construction, the computations, numerical and physical simulations and physical tests. The difficulties and compromises, both mechanical and electrical, are also mentioned. A section is dedicated to the organization and team management that led to the success of this project. This project led to the realization of electronic and mechanical circuits, the development of a software able to manage all the components and constraints in real time as well as the creation of a control system.
